NAME
    App::single - An application to run a single instance of a command

VERSION
    0.03

DESCRIPTION
    App::single is an application which allow you to run a single instance
    of a command. Example usage is from a cron:

      * * * * * /usr/local/bin/single autossh example.com sleep 86400 2>/dev/null 1>/dev/null

    The way it works is that it makes a temporarily file which include
    information about the process. Information written to the file includes
    the PID of the process, so the second time "single" is started with the
    same arguments it will check if the PID is alive.

    NOTE: This script is not atomic, but more than good enough for handling
    the "crontab" case.

SYNOPSIS
      $ single <command>
      $ single autossh example.com sleep 864000
      $ single "echo 123;sleep 86400";

    NOTE: Including shell characters (such as ">", "|", ";", ...) will
    invoke the shell, allowing unsafe user input.

INSTALLATION
    The easiest way to get this application is by using cpanminus:

      $ curl -L http://cpanmin.us | perl -n - --sudo App::single

    Note: "--sudo" is to install "single" system wide, "-n" is to skip tests
    for faster installation.
